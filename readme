# AI Web Scraper

This project is an AI-powered web scraper that allows users to extract and parse specific information from websites using natural language instructions.

## Features

1. Web Scraping: Extracts content from any given URL.
2. Text Cleaning: Removes unnecessary HTML elements and formats the extracted content.
3. AI-Powered Parsing: Uses the Ollama language model to interpret user instructions and extract relevant information.
4. User-Friendly Interface: Built with Streamlit for easy interaction.

## How It Works

1. The user enters a URL to scrape.
2. The application scrapes the website and cleans the extracted text.
3. The user provides a description of the information they want to extract.
4. The AI model parses the content based on the user's instructions and returns the relevant information.

## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit app:
